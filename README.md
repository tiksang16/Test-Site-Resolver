# Selenium Python Testing Project

This repository is designed to demonstrate automated testing using **Selenium** with Python and an integrated workflow for deploying test sites and reports. It includes the following:

1. A test site hosted on AWS S3: [Test Site](http://selenium-python-resolver.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)
2. Automated Selenium tests that generate an **Allure Report**.
3. GitHub Actions workflows to:
   - Automatically deploy the test site to AWS S3 when changes are made.
   - Run Selenium tests, generate an Allure Report, and deploy the report to AWS S3: [Allure Report](https://allure-report-resolver.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

---

## **Workflow Overview**

### **1. Local Testing Workflow**
Users can clone the repository and run Selenium tests locally using Python. The steps include:
- Setting up a Python virtual environment.
- Installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Running the Selenium tests.
- Viewing the test report generated by Allure.

### **2. Automated Deployment and Testing Workflow**
This repository includes two GitHub Actions workflows:
1. **`deploy-s3.yml`: Deploys the test site's HTML file (`QE-index.html`) to AWS S3 when changes are pushed to the repository.**
   - Trigger: Push to `resources/QE-index.html`.
   - Deploys the test site to [Test Site URL](http://selenium-python-resolver.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/).

2. **`selenium-tests.yml`: Runs the Selenium tests, generates an Allure Report, and deploys it to AWS S3.**
   - Trigger: Push to the `main` branch or manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Deploys the Allure report to [Allure Report URL](https://allure-report-resolver.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## **Technologies Used**

### **Programming Languages**
- **Python**: For writing Selenium test scripts and managing dependencies.

### **Testing Frameworks and Tools**
- **Selenium**: For automating browser interactions.
- **Pytest**: For organizing and running test cases.
- **Allure**: For generating detailed and interactive test reports.

### **Cloud Services**
- **AWS S3**: For hosting the test site and Allure reports.

### **CI/CD**
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating deployment and testing pipelines.

## **How to Run the Tests Locally**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### **2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**
Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# On Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the Selenium Tests**
Run the Selenium tests using Pytest. This will execute the test cases and generate the test results in a directory that can later be used to create an Allure Report:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=reports
```

### **5. View the Allure Report**

```bash
allure serve reports
```

## **GitHub Actions Workflow**

### 1. **Deploy Test Site to AWS S3**
The `deploy-s3.yml` workflow automatically deploys the `QE-index.html` file to the S3 bucket whenever it is updated.

#### **Trigger**
- Push to `resources/QE-index.html`.

#### **Process**
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Configures AWS credentials using GitHub Secrets.
3. Deploys `QE-index.html` to the specified AWS S3 bucket.

---

### 2. **Run Selenium Tests and Deploy Allure Report**
The `selenium-tests.yml` workflow runs Selenium tests and deploys the Allure report to AWS S3.

#### **Trigger**
- Push to the `main` branch.
- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.

#### **Process**
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Sets up Python and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Installs Chrome and its dependencies on the GitHub Actions runner.
4. Runs Selenium tests using `Pytest` and generates test results in the `reports` directory.
5. Installs Allure CLI and generates an interactive Allure report.
6. Uploads the generated Allure report to the specified S3 bucket.

---

## How to Trigger Tests Manually on GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Select the **Run Selenium Tests and Deploy Allure Report** workflow.
3. Click on **Run workflow** and follow the instructions.

#### **Once the pipeline completes:**
- Test results will be available in the Allure Report.
